                    It is clear that the matter of malpractice is still the main
                    challenging issue for every single malpractice lawyer in
                    Turkey. Law contains binding rules that govern the rights
                    and responsibilities of medical staff, health workers,
                    medical companies and the people using medical facilities
                    and services. This article analyzes the meaning of medical
                    malpractice and the best legal ways of finalizing
                    malpractice disputes. Other healthcare issues are beyond the
                    scope of this article.

                    Medical malpractice may take place because of “a negligent
                    mistake” or “below the standard of care”. The term means any
                    failure, mistake or unreasonable delay in, amongst others,
                    diagnosing a patient’s situation, giving wrong prescriptions
                    or making unnecessary or wrong surgeries.

                    There are two main sources for highlighting occupational
                    responsibilities of healthcare professionals in Turkey.
                    First, the Hippocratic Oath and second, Turkish legal
                    framework.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    The Hippocratic Oath contains ethical principles
                    particularly for medical professionals. Pursuant to these
                    principles, doctors should do the best for treating patients
                    and respecting or preserving the privacy of them.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    It is significant to state here that the Hippocratic
                    Principles are not legally binding; albeit morally binding
                    rules. Accordingly, only concrete legal norms have a
                    capacity to fill this gap.

                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Turkey has a comprehensive legal framework intended to
                    govern the rights and liabilities of doctors or other
                    providers. Indeed there are a wide variety of regulations
                    and laws dedicated to the healthcare sector in Turkey.
                    Besides, established case-law of justice institutions make a
                    substantial contribution to better implementation of Turkish
                    legislations.

              4. What are the main legal steps for malpractice in Turkey?

                  <p>
                    Malpractice cases generally result from the underperformance
                    of medical specialists. For any kind of application, the
                    nature of underperformance should be well researched and
                    documented. It should be emphasized that this job is far
                    from simple. Especially responding to the question of who is
                    accountable and the question of which act or action and
                    ignorance is problematic is very difficult.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Domestic legal framework contains leading rules that
                    structure what relevant staff should do, and what they may
                    not do for an appropriate treatment service. Nevertheless,
                    after detecting inappropriate treatment or the person acting
                    in an improper manner, another challenge arises out. In this
                    respect, jurisdiction has been a matter of concern for every
                    single healthcare lawyer.

                4.1. What are the main types of malpractice cases?
                <li>
                  <p>
                    In general, where malpractice action takes place under the
                    umbrella of a state hospital and/or a hospital belonging to
                    the public, the victim can lodge an application before the
                    administrative justice. In that case, malpractice is
                    regarded as constituting a “service fault”. This should be a
                    compensation case.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    But if malpractice results from an action of a private
                    person or entity, the relevant person may be issued before
                    judicial justice. In this situation, malpractice means an
                    “individual fault”. Doctors, nurses, surgeons, physicians,
                    psychiatrists, dentists or allied health workers may be
                    regarded as “accused” or “suspected” in a criminal case. But
                    it is very critical to be aware that victims have a right to
                    bring a compensation action before judicial justice, too.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Institution of the right application before the right
                    judicial body plays a key role in satisfying the victim. Any
                    mistake at this stage may have a crippling impact on
                    reaching proper legal outcomes.

                    In the final analysis, it is worth reiterating that the
                    Hippocratic Oath presents main moral principles to be
                    undertaken by healthcare workers. But, the said Oath is not
                    law. Accordingly, national healthcare systems need more than
                    this to draw legal borders of medical liabilities. In this
                    respect, the Turkish legal healthcare regime is designed to
                    a broad range of principles including the Hippocratic Oath
                    and other additional legal obligations.

                  <p>
                    There is no doubt that medical professionals are found
                    accountable for their underperformance in Turkey.However,
                    the search for improper treatment, the detection of
                    underperformance of medical staff, the determination of the
                    accountable person and the selection of a competent judicial
                    body present main challenges for victims and their families.
                    Even any malpractice lawyer may face enormous problems for
                    any malpractice dispute because of its complexitiy.
                    Accordingly, malpractice cases need extensive legal advice
                    for every single stage of the concerned legal process.
                    Victims or their families may handle complexities of a
                    malpractice litigation only owing to a full-fledged
                    consultation by healthcare law specialists.
