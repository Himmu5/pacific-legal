                The versatility of our practice areas greatly benefits clientsâ€”banks, companies, private equity firms, public utilities, non-profits, and individuals. Because of evolving laws and regulations, 
                coupled with increased scrutiny into corporate governance and compensation practices, publicly traded corporations, privately held entities, and their executives and directors are facing a more
                complex environment than even a year ago.
